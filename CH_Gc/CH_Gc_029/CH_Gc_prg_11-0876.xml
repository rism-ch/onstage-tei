This instrument is the latcst prodoct of the famous Weber factory at Hayes, Middlesex- It is a triumph alike for its producers and for British craftsmanship, for never have any foreign makers succeeded in obtaining so rare a tone in an instrument of such limited proportions.
Less tnan five feet in length, it occupies almost the same space as an ordinary upright piano, but has ail the advantages of tone and appearance that characterise the Grand type of piano-
The tone of the Weber Concert Grand Piano has made that instrument the choice of the world's chief pianists, and in this miniature model ail the beauties of the Weber tone are preserved.

IT is essential for success that ail announcements of forthcoming events should receive the greatest possible publicity amongst the regular entertainment-going public.	.
IT is also an undisputed fact that readers of ŒbC ÎTllllCô are the class ot patrons who provide the best support of the Entertainment World. It is obvious, therefore, that every concert and other entertainment announcement should secure a place in its columns,—both from the point of view of the organizers and the artists.	nio
A RECENT innovation in Œbe ŒltllCB is the ENTERTAINMENT PAGE, containing full particulars of Opéra, Theatres, Varieties, Cinémas, Concerts, Entertainments, Lectures, Exhibitions, &c., together with éditorial notes ana criticisms.	.
THE New Feature has already proved extremely popular with readers of Œbe Stmee, as it not only provides a ready means of reference but a REAL ENTERTAINMENT GUIDE.

ALBERT COATES
    Albert Coates was born in Petrograd of English parents and spent ail his early childhood in Russia. At the âge of 12 he was sent to England to school, receiving most of his éducation at the Liverpool Institute. At the âge of 18 he returned home, and his father, fearing the uncertainty of an artistic career for his son, placed him in his own office at the Thornton Woollen Mills, Petrograd. Here young Albert spent his' time writing music. His father, finding his accounts inevitably behindhaud, ofteu remarked that he did not understand how the boy managed to do so little in so much time. One day, however, he caught him dotting down notes—part of a movement for a violin sonata—in the ledger, and realiziug that he would never make a business man of him, he decided to give him a chance with his own bent. He sent him to L,eipsic, where he studied piano, ’cello and composition. In 1904 Nikisch opened a conducting class at the Conservatoire, and Coates very soon became the master’s favourite pupil. Nikisch, watching the young man conducting with volcanic temperament, many a time remarked, “ The conducting stick seems insufficient for your feelings, Coates ; you’d better take a whip.” It was Nikisch, however, who persuaded him to give up the piano and become a conductor. Coates followed the advice. Nikisch, on becoming director at the L,eipsic Opéra House, immediately engaged young Coates as his junior conductor. In 1909 the Director of the Petrograd Impérial Opéra, hearing him conduct The Walkïire, ofFered him the post of senior conductor and artistic director in Petrograd. Coates, pleased to get back to his old home, accepted, and soon became one of the most popular conductors in Russia. In 1914 Coates conducted for the first time at Covent Garden during the Wagner Season, and with such success that the Covent Garden Syndicate re-engaged him for the Grand Season, during which he shared the work with his old professor, Nikisch conducting the Ring, and Coates Tristan, Mastersingers and Pars if al.
    In 1917, when the révolution broke out in Russia and the opéra director for the Czar resigned his office, the artistes of the Petrograd Theatre formed a Managing Committee (choosing the members from amongst themselves by vote) and ran their Opéra House independently of any political party. Coates was unani-mously chosen as président. .They induced the Revolutionary Government to acknowledge their autonomy, and managed so
89
well that wheu the Bolsheivks came into power thev in their turn confirmed their iudependence and left them to work for them-selves. So the artistes, working araicably together without jealousy or intrigues, managed to keep their artistic flag flying until they were beaten in the uneven fight with—starvation. Hunger sapped their strength, and at a rehearsal when Coates asked the orchestra to repeat a passage the men answered him, “ We cannot. We’re too hungry ! ” Coates had to face a grimmer tragedy than this. One after another the men disappeared, and he was told that they had died of starvation ! The same happened in the chorus. Coates was very attached to both orchestra and chorus, and the daily tragedy of their suiïerings and his inability to help broke him up. He fell ill, blood poisoning set in and he lay two months at death’s door. However, bad as the illness was, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, for through it Mrs. Coates, with the help of the doctor, managed to convince the authorities that Coates would die if he remained in Russia and that he must be given two months’ leave to go to a Sanatorium in Finland. After endless difficulties Mrs. Coates at last collected ail the library of documents necessary for leaving the country, and they got safely over the border into Finland.
    In May last, Coates arrived in England and was at once engaged by Sir Thomas Beecham as senior conductor and co-artistic director for the English opéra. Coates thus realized one of his cherished dreams, namely, working for English opéra in England. This had so much been his idéal that wheu shortly before the révolution the Petrograd director offered him a new contract for five years, he refused to bind himself for so long, telling the director that he was sure that after the war there would be a great movement in England for national music, national opéra, etc., and that if his surmise proved true he intended to go to England to do his bit in seeing it through.

        <page><![CDATA[﻿GLASGOW
    An open meeting was held on the 6th March to discuss whether the teaching of the staff-system should be made général in primary sehools. In Scotland the tonie sol-fa is much taught but is now generally felt to be too limited in its application to be of use in later life when the scholars desire to join a choir, or play on some instrument.
    Mr. John Cullin, who has made a spécial study of the subject and has long experience in teaching, opened the debate by shewing how circumstances have altered since the général adoption of the tonie sol-fa forty years ago. At that time it was possible for a child to have only four or five years of school work, and it was resolved that in that short period the teaching of the simpler notation wTas ail that could be attempted ; to-day, however, the average school-life is one of eleven years, and there is, therefore, ample time in which to acquire a grasp of that staff in which ail new music is written, and which is the script of the whole civilised world.
    Mr. Cullin also gave it as the resuit of his experience that, as the faculty of reading music-script is largely a matter of eye, it is of great importance that the eye should be trained in it from an early âge.
    Some discussion resulted in a resolution that the society should urge upon the Education Authorities the necessity for the study of sight reading from the staff notation in the Primary Sehools, coupled with a recommendation that teachers should test their pupils singly for reading, as class reading is no test of the individual.
    It is hoped that other centres and branches will use their influence to the same end.

    Several members of the centre have been successful in securing a hearing for their recent compositions, among some notable productions by local cotnposers being Mr. Ernest Bryson’s poem, The Stranger, for solo voice, chorus and small orchestra, which was performed by the Liverpool Philharmonie Society under the direction of Mr. Geoffrey Toye, Miss Astra Desmond taking the solo part. The local press were unanimous in their praise. Dr. James Eyon’s Melomime was produced at the Shakespeare Theatre by the Phillips Opéra Company, who are to be congratulated on their enterprise in affording a British composer a hearing, and the reception of the work was a complété justification. Mr. Alfred C. Reynold’s Orchestral Suite. Vasantasena, derived from the musical play, The Toy Gart, received an excellent performance at the hands of the Bradford Permanent Orchestra, under the bâton of the composer.
    As an example of volunteer work in the development of the appréciation of music in the young must be cited the excellent propaganda work of the Stirland Trio who are enthusiastic amateurs and members of the local centre—who are devoting their evenings to giving educational récitals to the children of the Elementary Schools under the auspices of the Art Studies Association. Prior to the concert a lesson is given on the annotated programme to each child, and during the course of the performance still further détails are pointed out, thus combining the pleasures of a concert with the advantages of a lesson. The Educational Authorities are following the developments of the movement with interest, and great hopes are entertained of far reaching results for this innovation, the détails of which have been arranged by'Messrs. Rushworth and Dreaper.
NELSON
    The Nelson Branch of the B.M.S. is progressing favourably. Under the title of the Nelson Clef Club, it is proposed to hold 12 fortnightly meetings during the session. Six of these will be explanatory music récitals under the direction of our best local musicians. At these meetings, anything of an interesting nature, i e , the life of the composer, the particular period or mood in which the work was written, the form or any peculiarity in construction, any mélodie, harmonie, or rhythmic novelty will be pointed out and commented upon.
